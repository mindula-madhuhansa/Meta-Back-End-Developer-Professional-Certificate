1. The abuse of API calls made by an end-user can be managed and restricted by means of:
   - [ ] Caching
   - [x] **Rate-limiting**
   - [ ] Monitoring
   - [ ] Versioning
        >   Rate-limiting limits the number end-user can call your API in a period of time such as per minute, hour or day.

2. While monitoring API endpoints for indicators such as latency and response time, which of the following HTTP status codes can be used to identify potential problems early on? Select all that apply.
   - [ ] 100-199
   - [ ] 200-299
   - [x] **400-499**
        >   Status codes 400-499 imply client-side errors that can give an early indication of delays caused by potential problems.
   - [x] **500-599**
        >   Status codes 500-599 imply server-side errors that can provide an early indication of delays caused by potential problems.

3. SSL certificates ensure that the API calls coming to a specific vendor website such as Little Lemon are coming from their own website and mobile app.
   - [ ] True
   - [x] **False**
        >   SSL certificates are used to encrypt data and help serve data over HTTPS instead of HTTP. Signed URLs ensure that the API calls coming to a specific vendor website such as Little Lemon are coming from their own website and mobile app.

4. Which of the following HTTP status codes suggest authentication and authorization errors while communicating data over HTTP? Select all that apply.
   - [x] **401**
        >   The 401 – Unauthorized error is raised when the username and password credentials do not match the records available within the server.
   - [x] **402**
        >   The 402 – Forbidden error is raised when the credentials are valid, but the client does not have the privilege to perform the action.
   - [ ] 404

5. The SSL in SSL certificates, commonly known for being used in secure communications stand for:
   - [x] **Secure Socket Layer**
        >   Secure Socket Layers encrypt your data and generate certificates to enable communication over HTTPS.
   - [ ] Security Socket Layer
   - [ ] Secure Secret Layer
   - [ ] Socket Secure Layer
