1. You updated the **urlpatterns** inside the **urls.py** with a path for accessing books on the webpage. What is the correct syntax of the string that you passed to generate the **SingleBookView**?

   - [x] **books/<int:pk>**
   - [ ] books/<pk:int>
   - [ ] books/<pk>
   - [ ] books/int:pk
     > The URL dispatcher is updated with the variable **pk** and converter type **<int>** after the initial path for ‘**books/**’.

2. Which of the following arguments did you pass inside the view while declaring the **SingleBookView()**?

   - [x] **generics.RetrieveUpdateAPIView**
   - [ ] generics.ListCreateAPIView
   - [ ] ListCreateAPIView
   - [ ] RetrieveUpdateAPIView
     > The RetrieveUpdateAPIView inside the generics package is used to update endpoint using the GET, PUT and PATCH method headers.

3. When you run the server and open the webpage, which of the following are valid API endpoints that can be configured? Remember, a valid endpoint is any URL that will not show the yellow page error in Django. Choose all that apply.
   - [ ] http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/books/
   - [x] **http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/books**
     > This is a valid URL that will return all the books inside the database table from the template generated by DRF.
   - [x] **http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/books/1**
     > The URL will generate a **GET** request and allow the server to fetch the details of the book with **id 1**.
   - [ ] http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/
