1. Which column can be used as the primary key in the following student table?
    
    | StudentName | Date Of Birth | Email             |
    |-------------|---------------|-------------------|
    | Tim         | 19/03/2000    | tim.k@email.com   |
    | Mark        | 20/05/1999    | mark.f@email.com  |
    | Mark        | 10/03/2001    | mark.g@email.com  |
    | Peter       | 19/03/2000    | peter.s@email.com |

    - [ ] Student name
    - [ ] Date of Birth
    - [x] **Email**
        > This column is the right choice because it contains unique values in each row of the table.

2. What type of primary key is used in the following Sales table?
    
    | Customer ID | Order ID | Product Code | Quantity |
    |-------------|----------|--------------|----------|
    | Cu01        | Or10     | Pro123       | 10       |
    | Cu02        | Or11     | Pro153       | 12       |
    | Cu01        | Or10     | Pro124       | 16       |
    | Cu02        | Or12     | Pro123       | 11       |

    - [ ] A primary key represented by the Customer ID column.
    - [x] **A composite primary key represented by Customer ID and Product Code columns.**
        > Thereâ€™s no single column that can be used as a primary key. So, the best approach is to use multiple columns as a composite primary key.

3. You need to create a table for staff members in a college. You must define the email address column as the primary key. Can the following SQL syntax be used to complete this task?
<br/>`CREATE TABLE Staff( Email VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL, Name varchar(255) NOT NULL, CONSTRAINT PK_Email PRIMARY KEY (Email));`
    - [ ] No
    - [x] **Yes**
        > The constraint has been used in a proper way to define the email address as a primary key.

4. The following SQL code defines three primary keys: SalesID, CustomerID and ProductID.
<br/>`CONSTRAINT SalesID PRIMARY KEY (customerID, productID);`
    - [x] **False**
    - [ ] True
        > In this example there is only ONE PRIMARY KEY (SalesID). However, the VALUE of the primary key is made up of TWO COLUMNS (customerID +productID).

5. Which of the following statements is the correct SQL syntax to define a foreign key that links the orders table with the customers table in the following diagram?

    - [ ] CREATE TABLE Orders ( OrderID int NOT NULL, CustomerID int, PRIMARY KEY (OrderID), FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers(OrderID));
    - [x] **CREATE TABLE Orders ( OrderID int NOT NULL, CustomerID int, PRIMARY KEY (OrderID), FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers(CustomerID));**
        > In this example the SQL statement creates a FOREIGN KEY on the "customerID" column when the "Orders" table is created.
