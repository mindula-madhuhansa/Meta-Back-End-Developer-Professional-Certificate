1. The correct command to remove a record from a table is: DROP FROM
    - [ ] True
    - [x] **False**
        > The DROP command is used to drop an existing database or a table in a database. The right command is DELETE FROM

2. You can delete all records of data from a table without deleting the table itself using the SQL command DELETE FROM.
    - [ ] False
    - [x] **True**
        > This SQL statement deletes all records of data from a table, without deleting the table.

3. You can delete the record of the player assigned the number seven from the table “Players” using the following SQL syntax:<br/>DELETE  FROM players<br/>WHERE playerNumber = seven;
    - [x] **False**
    - [ ] True
        > The correct syntax to delete the record of data where the player number is 7 is:<br/>DELETE  FROM players<br/>WHERE playerNumber =  7;

4. You can delete all records from a table called "Players" where the value of City is equal to "London" using the following SQL syntax:
    - [x] **True**
    - [ ] False
        > This is the right SQL statement to delete all the records from the player’s table where the city = 'London'.
