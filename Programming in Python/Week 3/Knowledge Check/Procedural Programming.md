1. Which of the algorithm types below finds the best solution in each and every step instead of being overall optimal?
    - [ ] Dynamic Programming
    - [ ] Divide and conquer
    - [x] **Greedy**
    - [ ] Recursive
        > Greedy algorithms optimise at every step.

2. Which of the following Big O notations for function types has the slowest time complexity?
    - [ ] O(log(n))
    - [ ] O(c)
    - [x] **O(n!)**
    - [ ] O(n^3)
        > O(n!) has the slowest time complexity.

3. True or False: Linear time algorithms will always run under the same time and space regardless of the size of input. 
    - [ ] True
    - [x] **False**
        > This is the definition of Constant time complexity. Linear time is dependent on the size of the input.

4. For determining efficiency, which of the following factors must be considered important?
    - [ ] Time complexity
    - [ ] Space complexity
    - [ ] Neither of the two options above
    - [x] **Both A and B**
        > Both time and space complexity are important
